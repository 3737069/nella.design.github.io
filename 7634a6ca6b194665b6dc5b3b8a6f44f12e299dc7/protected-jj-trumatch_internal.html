                        TomoFix is a patient-specific medical device used in
                        knee surgery that reduces surgery time and improves
                        patient outcome. However, the ordering process involves
                        a lot of paperwork and is overall a clunky experience.

                        The goal is to digitalize the end-to-end service to
                        better serve surgeons and improve work efficiency for
                        the China market.

                    <p>
                        Working in a cross-functional team, I was responsible
                        for defining user flows and prototyping key features of
                        the TRUMATCH™ surgeon portal MVP. I also created a UI
                        style guide and worked with the developers in China to
                        ensure the platform comes to life. The result is a
                        shortened lead time from 10 days to 5 days and improved
                        user satisfaction.

                    <p>
                        While TomoFix has its benefits of shortened surgery time
                        and improved patient outcome, the patient-specific
                        instrumentation (PSI) journey introduces added
                        complexity. It involves additional stakeholders,
                        paperwork, and communication across teams. Surgeons may
                        choose conventional methods over PSI due to a lack of
                        trust in the existing process.

                            research had been conducted by an external service
                            design agency, which meant we had to quickly bridge
                            knowledge gaps and catch up on prior insights.

                        It was my first time working with the China team and it
                        challenged me to adapt to a fast-paced environment, the
                        key was to have frequent check-ins to make sure
                        expectations were aligned.

                    <p>
                        Another key take away was to design the home dashboard
                        last, by focusing first on the core flows, it became
                        easier to design a functional home dashboard that meets
                        the surgeons' needs.
